# Warehouse Actor

This repository contains a `Warehouse` actor implemented in Motoko. The `Warehouse` actor manages a collection of products, allowing you to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on them. It stores products in a Trie-based data structure for efficient lookups by their unique `ProductId`.

## Features

- **Create a Product**: Add a new product to the warehouse.
- **Read a Product**: Retrieve the details of a specific product by its ID.
- **Update a Product**: Modify the details of an existing product.
- **Delete a Product**: Remove a product from the warehouse.
- **Read All Products**: Retrieve a list of all products in the warehouse.

## Types

### `Product`
A product in the warehouse has the following fields:

- **name**: `Text` – The name of the product.
- **category**: `Text` – The category the product belongs to.
- **weight**: `Float` – The weight of the product.
- **dimensions**: A record containing:
  - **width**: `Float` – The width of the product.
  - **height**: `Float` – The height of the product.
  - **depth**: `Float` – The depth of the product.
- **arrivalTime**: `Time` – The time when the product arrived in the warehouse.
- **estimatedDepartureTime**: `Time` – The estimated time when the product will leave the warehouse.
- **actualDepartureTime**: `?Time` – The actual time when the product left the warehouse (optional).
- **storageCost**: `Float` – The storage cost associated with the product.

### `ProductId`
A `ProductId` is a `Nat32` (32-bit unsigned integer) used to uniquely identify each product in the warehouse.

### `Time`
A `Time` is represented as an `Int`, typically denoting a timestamp or time in some units (e.g., Unix timestamp).

## Methods

### `create(product: Product) -> async ProductId`
Creates a new product in the warehouse and returns its `ProductId`.

#### Parameters:
- `product`: The product details to be added.

#### Returns:
- A `ProductId` of the newly created product.

### `read(productId: ProductId) -> async ?Product`
Reads the details of a product by its ID.

#### Parameters:
- `productId`: The `ProductId` of the product to be read.

#### Returns:
- An optional `Product` (`?Product`), which is `null` if the product does not exist.

### `update(productId: ProductId, product: Product) -> async Bool`
Updates an existing product's details. Returns `true` if the product was found and updated, and `false` otherwise.

#### Parameters:
- `productId`: The `ProductId` of the product to update.
- `product`: The new product details to be updated.

#### Returns:
- `true` if the product exists and was updated; `false` otherwise.

### `delete(productId: ProductId) -> async Bool`
Deletes a product from the warehouse. Returns `true` if the product existed and was deleted, and `false` otherwise.

#### Parameters:
- `productId`: The `ProductId` of the product to delete.

#### Returns:
- `true` if the product existed and was deleted; `false` otherwise.

### `readAll() -> async [Product]`
Reads all products in the warehouse and returns them as a list.

#### Returns:
- A list of `Product` objects representing all the products in the warehouse.

## Storage

The products are stored in a `Trie`, indexed by their `ProductId`. This ensures efficient lookups, additions, and deletions.

- **`next`**: A stable variable that tracks the next `ProductId` to be assigned to a new product.
- **`products`**: A stable variable holding the `Trie` that maps `ProductId` to `Product`.

## Example Usage

Here’s how you can interact with the `Warehouse` actor:

1. **Create a Product**:
   ```motoko
   let newProduct = {
     name = "Widget";
     category = "Gadgets";
     weight = 2.5;
     dimensions = { width = 5.0; height = 5.0; depth = 10.0 };
     arrivalTime = 1638900000;
     estimatedDepartureTime = 1639900000;
     actualDepartureTime = null;
     storageCost = 10.0;
   };

   let productId = await warehouse.create(newProduct);
   ```

2. **Read a Product**:
   ```motoko
   let product = await warehouse.read(productId);
   ```

3. **Update a Product**:
   ```motoko
   let updatedProduct = {
     name = "Updated Widget";
     category = "Gadgets";
     weight = 2.6;
     dimensions = { width = 5.5; height = 5.5; depth = 10.5 };
     arrivalTime = 1638900000;
     estimatedDepartureTime = 1640000000;
     actualDepartureTime = null;
     storageCost = 12.0;
   };

   let updated = await warehouse.update(productId, updatedProduct);
   ```

4. **Delete a Product**:
   ```motoko
   let deleted = await warehouse.delete(productId);
   ```

5. **Read All Products**:
   ```motoko
   let allProducts = await warehouse.readAll();
   ```
